from datetime import *
'''
    Write a function that displays todayâ€™s date.
    The function should also display the amount of
    time left from now until the next upcoming holiday
    and print which holiday that is. (Example: the next
    holiday is in 30 days and 12:03:45 hours).
    Hint: Start by hardcoding the datetime and name of the upcoming holiday.
